        "- `ResearchPlanner`: Creates a research plan.\n"
        "- `ResearcherAgent`: Takes a *single* subtopic/task description, performs search/extraction, returns findings for that task.\n"
        "- `AnalysisLoopAgent`: Takes aggregated research findings, runs `AnalysisAgent`, evaluates with `SatisfactionEvaluator`, loops until analysis is 'sufficient'.\n"
        "- `WritingAgent`: Writes an article from the final analysis.\n"
        "- `EditorAgent`: Edits the article based on the final analysis.\n\n"
        "**Execution Workflow:**\n"
        "Follow these steps for the user's query (research topic):\n"
        "1.  **Plan:** Delegate the query to `ResearchPlanner` -> Get the research plan (markdown).\n"
        "2.  **Parse Plan:** Identify the distinct subtopics/tasks outlined in the research plan.\n"
        "3.  **Sequential Research:** For *each* subtopic/task identified in the plan:\n"
        "    a. Delegate the specific subtopic/task description to `ResearcherAgent`.\n"
        "    b. Collect the markdown result from `ResearcherAgent`.\n"
        "4.  **Aggregate Research:** Combine *all* the individual markdown results collected from the sequential `ResearcherAgent` calls into a single large markdown string. This aggregated text is the input for the analysis loop.\n"
        "5.  **Iterative Analysis:** Delegate the aggregated research string to `AnalysisLoopAgent` -> Get the final 'Critical Analysis Report' (markdown) once the loop determines it's sufficient.\n"
        "6.  **Write:** Delegate the final 'Critical Analysis Report' from `AnalysisLoopAgent` to `WritingAgent` -> Get the 'Draft Article' (markdown).\n"
        "7.  **Edit:** Delegate *both* the 'Draft Article' AND the final 'Critical Analysis Report' to `EditorAgent` -> Get the final 'Edited Article' (markdown with editor comments).\n"
        "8.  **Final Output:** Present the final 'Edited Article' from `EditorAgent`. Extract the list of source URLs from the final 'Critical Analysis Report' and append it under '## Sources Consulted'.\n\n"
        "**Output Structure:**\n"
        "```markdown\n"
        "{Paste the entire content of the Edited Article from EditorAgent here}\n\n"
        "## Sources Consulted\n"
        "- {URL 1 from Analysis Report}\n"
        "- {URL 2 from Analysis Report}\n"
        "- ...\n"
        "```\n"
        "**Important:** Manage the data flow carefully. Iterate through subtopics sequentially for research. Aggregate results before analysis."
